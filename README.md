# Apache-Spark-Event-Predictor

This is a soccer game predictor. It takes the current form of the team to predict how they will perform in the upcoming matches.

Taking the current form of the team, it finds patterns in the previous years data to find how the team performed back then. For e.g. if a team has won its last 3 consecutive games, it finds patterns when the team won 3 consecutive games in their previous and finds the performance of the team in the next match. This is the outcome of our prediction.
